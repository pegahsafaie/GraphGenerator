Alonso Quixada lives quietly in a village in La Mancha. He isn’t rich, but he’s happy and he loves reading books about knights. He decides to set off on an adventure with a suit of armour, a helmet and his horse, Rocinante. He imagines a local girl, Aldonza Lorenzo, to be the loveliest woman in the world and his ‘princess’. He arrives at an inn, which he thinks is a castle, and he attacks two men with his lance. Then, the innkeeper knights him and Don Quixote leaves. He comes across a man hitting a boy and tries unsuccessfully to defend him. Next, he meets some rich men and falls off his horse. The rich men think he is very funny. A man from Don Quixote’s village finds him and takes him home.



While Don Quixote is recovering at home, 
two of his friends, Pero and Nicolás, burn his books 
because they think they are bad for him. They tell him a 
wizard did it and Don Quixote calls the wizard Frestón. 
He then persuades a local man, Sancho Panza, to be 
his squire and they set off on another adventure. They 
come across some windmills and Don Quixote attacks 
them, thinking they are giants. Then, they see a doctor 
on a horse carrying a bowl. Don Quixote thinks it is a 
famous helmet and takes it from him. Next, Don Quixote 
mistakes some sheep for knights and attacks them. The 
owners of the sheep throw things at Don Quixote and 
some of his teeth fall out. 




On their next adventure, Don Quixote sends 
Sancho Panza to find Dulcinea. Knowing that Dulcinea 
is really a simple village girl, he takes three country girls 
on donkeys to Don Quixote. Don Quixote believes that 
one of the girls is his Dulcinea, but that she has been made ugly by Frestón, the wizard. Then, they meet 
another ‘knight’ and his ‘squire’. The new knight and Don 
Quixote plan to fight the following morning and the two 
squires drink and eat together. The next day, Don Quixote 
hits the other knight with his lance and Sancho Panza 
removes his helmet. They see the face of an old friend, 
Sansón Carrasco. The squire is also an old friend, but Don 
Quixote thinks they are products of Frestóns magic and 
sends them on their way.




Don Quixote meets a rich man called Don 
Diego de Miranda. Then they see some men on horses, 
pulling a large box with a lion inside. Don Quixote makes 
the driver open the box so that he can fight the lion. The 
lion ignores Don Quixote and Don Quixote thinks he has 
won the fight. Some days later, Don Quixote meets a man 
called Pedro at an inn. Pedro has a theatre company and 
a clever monkey. He tricks people into thinking that the 
monkey can see inside people’s heads




Sancho Panza tells Don Quixote that he 
wants to go home, where it’s more comfortable but then 
he changes his mind. The next day, they see some rich 
people on horses. They speak to a woman, Doña Maria, 
who invites them to her castle. The woman’s husband, 
Don Carlos, jokingly makes Sancho Panza king of a small 
country. As king, Sancho Panza solves a dispute about 
money between two old friends and helps the people in 
many other ways. However, the cook doesn’t feed him well 
and one night, some bad men try to kill him so he decides 
he doesn’t want to be king anymore.




Don Quixote and Sancho Panza leave the 
castle and meet some young people who know all about 
their adventures. Then, bulls and some men on horses 
come down the road.
Don Quixote wants to fight, but the 
bulls run over him and injure him. In an inn, he meets 
two men who have read that he no longer loves Dulcinea. 
Don Quixote tells them this is not true. Next, they travel 
to Barcelona. On the beach, Don Quixote fights the 
Knight of the White Mountains, who is really Sansón 
Carrasco. Don Quixote is badly hurt. He goes home and 
dies, realising before that he is, in fact, not a knight at all.
